You need to avoid collisions with space garbage.

## How to install

Python 3.7 has to be installed. You might have to run python3 instead of python depending on system if there is a conflict with Python2. Then use pip (or pip3) to install dependencies:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `python main.py`.

## Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
